# Computer Vision


## Milestone 1

 The first milestone was the same as before with the Hangman project and involved setting up a Github repository as well as the dev environment with the correct version of conda aswell as the libraries.

 ## Milestone 2

The second milestone was to create the computer vision system (model) using Teachable-Machine in order to create an image project model with four classes: Rock, Scissors, Paper and Nothing. I created this model using my webcam and recorded images zoomed in on my hand in each specific postion, with nothing being the images without my hand.

## Nothing

- Multiple copies of these images were taken to provide more samples for the model. This helped to improve the accuracy of the model's recognition of my hand along with the epochs trained - I ended up settling with 50 and the model was successful in recognising which move I played. 

- Then I downloaded the model as two seperate files: a `keras_model.h5` file and a `labels.txt` file containing the names of the classes. They contained the structure and parameters of the deep learning model which was used along with Python for the next milestone.
